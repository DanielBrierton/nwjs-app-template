# nwjs-app-template
A simple template I use to start building an [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) application.

It uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for the build, [Bower](http://bower.io/) for front-end dependencies, and [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) for AMD loading and optimization.

## Planned Features
* Unit and integration testing
* Acceptance testing

## Contributing
This is mainly for my own usage, but if anyone finds it useful and wants to extend upon it, I'm welcome to pull requests.
